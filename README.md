# Build-NN-from-scratch-with-NumPy
The goal of this notebook is to build a neural network from scratch using NumPy only to recognize hand written image, And that's because I belive it will help me to understand deeply how can NN and Deep Learning models train more than just use Deep Learning frameworks. So let us start!
